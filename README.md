## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Local Development (Vercel Dev)
The recommended way to run LifePulse locally is using the Vercel CLI, which handles both frontline and serverless functions correctly.
```bash
# Run the complete environment
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

### 2. Simple Static Server
If you only want to test the UI without AI features:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000
```

### 3. Legacy Local Server
For testing the legacy Express backend:
```bash
npm run dev:local
```
